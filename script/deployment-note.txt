To run the application locally using docker-compose, you have to install docker on your computer; once you have docker running on your computer, clone the repository from GitHub, and navigate to the root of the project. The application uses environment variables, so create your ".env" with the necessary variables and run the command "docker-compose -d up." this command will run the application in detach mode on port 5000 and also start the Mongo database in the container, which is also available on port 27017
